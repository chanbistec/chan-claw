Slide 1: Agent Evaluation in Microsoft Copilot Studio
Introduction to automated agent testing and quality assurance.

Slide 2: Why Agent Evaluation Matters
As AI agents take on critical business roles, reliable testing becomes essential for maintaining quality and trust.

Slide 3: What is Agent Evaluation?
Agent evaluation generates tests that simulate real-world scenarios, covering more questions faster than manual testing.

Slide 4: Key Benefits
- Automated, structured testing
- Catches problems early
- Reduces risk of bad answers
- Maintains quality as agents evolve

Slide 5: What Agent Evaluation Measures
- Accuracy of responses
- Relevancy to user questions
- Quality of answers
- Based on information the agent accesses

Slide 6: Test Cases Explained
A test case is a single message or question simulating what a user would ask your agent.

Slide 7: Example Test Case
Question: What are your business hours?
Expected Response: We are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.

Slide 8: Test Sets
A test set is a group of test cases that allows you to run multiple evaluations at once.

Slide 9: Test Set Capabilities
- Run multiple test cases simultaneously
- Analyze performance with aggregate scores
- Zoom in on individual test cases
- Compare performance changes over time

Slide 10: Generating Test Sets
You can generate test sets from knowledge or topics, import from files, or manually write test cases.

Slide 11: User Profiles
Choose a user profile to simulate different users sending questions. Agents may respond differently based on user context.

Slide 12: Running Evaluations
Copilot Studio sends questions, records responses, compares against expected answers, and assigns scores.

Slide 13: Test Chat vs Agent Evaluation
Test Chat: One question at a time, full conversation sessions.
Agent Evaluation: Multiple test cases at once, repeatable tests, objective scoring.

Slide 14: Important Limitations
Agent evaluation measures correctness, not AI ethics or safety. Always use responsible AI reviews and content safety filters.

Slide 15: Summary
Agent evaluation provides automated, repeatable quality assurance for your Copilot Studio agents.
