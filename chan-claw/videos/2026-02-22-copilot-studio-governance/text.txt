Slide 1: Copilot Studio Governance
A practical guide for agent developers on implementing effective governance in Microsoft Copilot Studio and the Power Platform.

Slide 2: Why Governance Matters
Without proper governance, organizations face data leaks, compliance violations, and shadow IT. Governance enables innovation while protecting your organization.

Slide 3: The Full Lockdown Problem
Blocking all app creation and restricting connectors pushes development to spreadsheets, email macros, and unsanctioned SaaS tools where IT has zero visibility.

Slide 4: Guardrails Over Gates
Microsoft recommends guardrails over gates. Implement environment strategy, data loss prevention policies, tenant isolation, managed environments, and deployment pipelines.

Slide 5: Copilot Studio Inherits Power Platform Governance
Copilot Studio shares the same architecture, security model, environment structure, and administration controls as Power Apps and Power Automate.

Slide 6: No Separate Framework Needed
If you already have Power Platform governance in place, you can immediately apply those same controls, monitoring tools, and processes to Copilot Studio.

Slide 7: Principle One - Environment Strategy
Create distinct environments that separate personal productivity, departmental development, testing areas, and production systems.

Slide 8: Environment Types
- Personal developer environments for experimentation
- Department or project dev and test environments
- Shared production environments with strict controls
- Route makers to personal environments by default

Slide 9: Principle Two - Default Deny Exfiltration
Implement security that prevents unauthorized data movement by default while enabling approved pathways through data loss prevention policies.

Slide 10: DLP Policy Design
- Categorize connectors into Business, Non-Business, and Blocked
- Apply granular endpoint and action restrictions
- Establish tenant isolation as a baseline control
- Use explicit allow-lists for cross-tenant scenarios

Slide 11: Principle Three - Automate Change Management
Standardize on Power Platform pipelines for application lifecycle management with approval-based delegated deployments for all production changes.

Slide 12: Pipeline Workflow
All changes to production environments must undergo appropriate review. Configure pipelines with approval workflows while still enabling maker empowerment and development agility.

Slide 13: Principle Four - Visibility and Iteration
Deploy the Center of Excellence Starter Kit for comprehensive asset inventory, metrics tracking, and automated governance workflows.

Slide 14: Monitoring Tools
- Center of Excellence Starter Kit for asset inventory
- Microsoft Purview for data access governance
- Microsoft Sentinel for audit logs and threat detection
- Continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns

Slide 15: Principle Five - Nurture the Maker Community
Foster responsible innovation by publishing clear rules of engagement, offering regular training, and maintaining accessible support channels.

Slide 16: Building Maker Culture
When makers understand the why behind governance policies, they become active partners in maintaining security and compliance rather than working around restrictions.

Slide 17: IT Manager Responsibilities
Own the platform guardrails. Define environment topology, activate tenant isolation, design DLP policies, and enable managed environments for production.

Slide 18: Environment Routing
Use environment routing to automatically direct makers to their personal developer environment when they access Copilot Studio or Power Apps.

Slide 19: Tenant Isolation
Activate tenant isolation to prevent unauthorized cross-tenant data movement. Create explicit allow-lists only for legitimate business scenarios like subsidiaries or partnerships.

Slide 20: Managed Environments
Enable managed environments for all production environments to gain advanced monitoring, enhanced sharing controls, and deeper operational insights.

Slide 21: Business Manager Responsibilities
Position Power Platform as the official automation tool. Encourage prototyping in personal environments with structured promotion paths to production.

Slide 22: Outcome-Based Guardrails
Document approved data sources, permitted connectors, and appropriate publication channels. Establish a lightweight approval process for handling exceptions.

Slide 23: Transparency Requirements
Every solution and agent must have a designated business owner, a purpose statement, appropriate data classification, and a defined lifecycle management plan.

Slide 24: Securing the Default Environment
Rename the default environment to Personal Productivity. Apply restrictive DLP policies. Block every blockable connector by default.

Slide 25: Default Environment DLP
Move all non-blockable connectors to Business category. Set the default group to Blocked so new connectors are automatically blocked without manual intervention.

Slide 26: Connector Governance
Connectors are the primary data egress vector. Use policies that are precise enough to protect data without stalling development work.

Slide 27: Layered Security Model
- Tenant-level DLP policies for organization-wide rules
- Environment-level DLP for specific contexts
- Connector endpoint filtering for granular control
- Action-level controls for specific operations

Slide 28: Agent Developer Best Practices
Start in personal dev environments. Follow the promotion path from dev to test to production. Document your agents with clear purpose and data classification.

Slide 29: Common Governance Mistakes
- Over-restricting connectors causes shadow IT
- No environment strategy leads to data mixing
- Skipping monitoring means no visibility into risks
- Ignoring maker community creates resistance

Slide 30: Summary and Next Steps
Effective governance enables innovation while protecting data. Use environment strategy, DLP policies, managed environments, pipelines, and the CoE Kit to build a secure foundation.
